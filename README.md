# Con2Gen
Another Static Site Generator --> used to generate content pages without the need to write code (after the generator is set up).

Currently planned to be markdown based, with modular/optional sections.

Design is currently WIP; everything in this document is subject to change

## Original Notes:
General Process:

- Create a sample page/template page with HTML/CSS/JS
- Add divs with div id "generator_template_SECTION_NAME"
  - Each template file will generate html/css/js formatted to what's inside the "generator_template_SECTION_NAME" div
- Extract template sections from the div ids
- Import content sections (filled in from each template)
- Combine content sections in the original order of the HTML/CSS/JS
- Generate pages with the "generator_template_SECTION_NAME" and similar template filler removed

Possible idea:

- User writes in markdown for each section
  - If using a CMS approach (like wordpress), the user types directly into an editor with a live preview of the page output
  - If just using the markdown approach, two options appear:
    1. A content section file is created for EACH "generator_template_SECTION_NAME"
    2. One markdown file is created for each page, where each "generator_template_SECTION_NAME" is a simple markdown element
       - This could be as simple as writing "#S.Instructions" before the "Instructions" section
- This needs to stay simple on the side of the content writing user
  - Anyone writing content should not have to care about anything beyond writing content for the sections they wish to include

## WIP Design Notes:
The main idea for this project is that a user (content writer) should not care about the underlying code when creating a new page (review, guide, recipe, etc).

For the first iteration of this project, only terminal commands will be used for generation --> no UI will be available. This means that users will write their files (either markdown or section files depending on the approach). These files will be compiled to match the template HTML/CSS/JS

Two ideas for making a page for a cooking website:

### Option 1, Templated Markdown, Sections:
- A sample recipe page is created in a frontend language of choice
- Empty wrappers are added around different sections of the sample page to mark where each part of a template begins/ends
  - Ex: The "ingredients" and "instructions" settings may have wrappers around them, so that section template files are created for "ingredients" and "instructions"
  - The author of the recipe page would add the ingredients as a bulleted list to `ingredients.md`, the instructions as a bulleted list to `instructions.md`
  - A section for "Recipe History" would have a `recipe_history.md` section that may just contain paragraphs of text
- The markdown files for each section are then compiled in the order that the generator is set up for (usually a direct match to the order of the sample file)

### Option 2, Templated Markdown, Single File:
- Similar process as above, but with a single file for each section

Advantages over markdown sections:
- Simplier to write --> page authors can just write markdown
- Only one file per content page
- Most intuitive approach for authors

Disadvantages over markdown sections:
- Reordering sections becomes annoying, as the markdown file would directly compile to the output html/css/js
- More difficult to add custom code

### Option 3, Hybrid Templated Markdown:
This option is designed to be a hybrid of the two approaches. Each content page will have exactly two files that the author will need to edit: `Content.md` and `Variables.md`
- `Content.md` will follow a similar to "Templated Markdown"
  - Author receives a markdown file with every section from the template available
  - These sections will be blank and follow the approach seen under "Example Empty Hybrid Content.md File"
  - Any sections that are auto generated by other code will start with the body `<Section.GeneratedSection>` to mark it as a generated section
  - `Content.md` is compiled down into a list of template sections for generation (Ex: `Instructions.section`, `Ingredients.section`)
    - These section files are inserted into the output HTML/CSS/JS in their respective spots (matching where they are in the sample/template page)
- `Variables.md` is a file that contains any variables used in the sample/template page
  - These variables are used directly in the template file
  - Ex: Title, Time, Servings, etc
  - Sample file can be found in `Example Empty Variables.md File`

#### Example Empty Hybrid Content.md File
Example of what an untouched content file looks like for a template that contains the sections "Description", "Instructions", "Ingredients", "Nutrition", "Images", and "Comments". For this example "Nutrition" is coded and static (at compile time), while "Comments" is a coded section that is dynamic and calls a database in production.

**NOTE: IMAGE STORAGE LOCATION IS STILL TBD**

```
#Section.Description


#Section.Instructions


#Section.Ingredients


#Section.Nutrition
<Section.GeneratedSection>

#Section.Images


#Section.Comments
<Section.GeneratedSection>

```

#### Example Empty Variables.md File
